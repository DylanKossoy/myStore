# myStore ‚Äì Authentication Practice Project

**myStore** is a full-stack development practice project built to help me understand and implement core backend concepts such as user registration, login authentication, password hashing, and database storage using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## üöÄ Purpose

This project is designed as a hands-on exercise to learn how the backend works under the hood. It focuses on creating secure user authentication flows and connecting a frontend interface to a real database using RESTful API endpoints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Security:** bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for login tokens
